use this config for ease of use (just replace the default config) :
[config.txt](https://github.com/jagt/clumsy/files/11858354/config.txt)


### most useful for echo
Lag (use 9000 outbound)
Bandwidth (maybe.. but you stutter around)

### known glitches and how to do them
- bypass arena respawn
- Instant goal (looks like the disk teleported into the goal)

**arena respawn :** grab and hold the disc while somebody scores it, then you need to wait till everyone respawns.. when you notice your screen doesn't go black press stop and voila you stay in the arena

**Instant Goal** :  grab the disc from somebody and throw it into the goal or put it in then immediately turn off the Lag

### Bandwidth (Outbound) 
11 - 13KB/s : light stutter every couple seconds
10KB/s : you look very stuttery
9KB/s  : you jump from place to place and basically freeze in between
