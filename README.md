### How to use
Download latest version of Clumsy
[(https://github.com/jagt/clumsy/releases)]

### Lag
use 9000ms and only outbound
: you are delayed for everyone else and stunning for example is gonna be 9 seconds delayed

### Known Glitches

**Teleport :** Just turn it on go somewhere and turn it off again

**bypass arena respawn :** you need to snatch the Disk from an Enemy which is gonna score so latch onto them and grab the disk before they score (you have a 7-10 sec time frame for that) 
then you need to watch out for the black respawn effect if it doesn't appear you can turn it off and hide behind nest

### Bandwidth (Outbound) 
11 - 13KB/s : light stuttery movement every couple seconds
10KB/s : you look stuttery
9KB/s - 4KB/s  : you jump from place to place and basically freeze in between or even disconnect completely
