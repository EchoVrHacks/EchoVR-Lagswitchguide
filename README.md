### How to use
replace the stock config in Clumsy with this one  :
[config.txt](https://github.com/jagt/clumsy/files/11858354/config.txt)


### Use lag and bandwidth only separately
Lag (use outbound 9000)
Bandwidth (look at the bottom)

### known glitches and how to do them
- bypass arena respawn
- Instant goal (looks like the disk teleported into the goal)

**bypass respawn :** turn on lag then hold the disk in your hand while somebody scores it and it should stay grabbable 
then you need to wait and if you don't see the black respawn effect you can turn it off

**teleport the disk** : turn on lag then grab the disc from somebody when they keep it for 2-3 seconds take it and throw it then quickly press stop voilah the disk teleported (people in match will say WHAT)

### Bandwidth (Outbound) 
11 - 13KB/s : light stutter every couple seconds
10KB/s : you look stuttery
9KB/s - 4KB/s  : you jump from place to place and basically freeze in between
